# Avocado Kitchen - A Smart Meal Plan App

This application allows the user to manage their weekly meal plan, and algorithmically formulates plans based on nutrition, user diet restrictions, and adjustable budget. Users can create and upload their own recipes to a community, where other users can like, comment, and download/modify the recipe for themselves. The application also automatically tracks recipe ingredients and, with the user's permission, auto-orders them from South Korea's Coupang and MarketKurly online stores.

### Figma Pre-Design

The initial designs of each major page were drafed on Figma, where aspects like the color palette, page layout, and general navigation was experimented. More pages were added throughout the process as the app expanded in functionality and pages.
